# Frontend Mentor - Easybank landing page

![Design preview for the Easybank landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this project.

You can find a preview of the design here: [preview](https://easybankproject.netlify.app/#)

## General

The design of this website is provided by [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

This website allows developers to use design ready to code. I coded the website by myself.

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS (SASS)
3. Javascript

Javascript has only a secondary place in this project. I only use it to open and close the hamburger menu.
The difficulty is in the integration of the design and its responsive side.

The site is responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
